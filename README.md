# youtube-summarizer

The code utilizes the LangChain library to load a YouTube video as text data, split it into chunks, and then use an AI model (Ollama) to generate summaries for each chunk. The summaries are then joined together and passed through the Ollama model again to produce a final summary of the original content. This process allows for the generation of detailed and coherent summaries based on the provided context.
